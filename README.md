**Built for:** CPSC 449 Programming Paradigms

**Description:** Apocalypse game created in Haskell using two simple AIs

**Methodologies:**
- Test driven development
- Some aspects of Adaptor design inplemented
- Functional and non functional requirements gathering

This project was created to gain a better understanding of Haskell concepts such as - List manipulation, IO operations, Haskell patterns. It contained three startegies
- human - Where the user enters the moves
- computer - Smart AI player which scans the entire board for best moves
- random - Dumb AI player which makes a random move

The program can be started in 2 modes.

**Command Line Start** ./Apoc.exe \[human|computer|random\] \[human|computer|random\]

**Interactive Mode Start** Simply run the Apoc.exe
